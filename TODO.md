# Project Setup and Fixes Completed

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Supabase Integration
- Created `src/lib/supabase.ts` with Supabase client configuration
- Updated `src/store/authStore.ts` to use Supabase auth and users table

### 2. Path Aliases
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to include path alias for '@' pointing to 'src'
- Updated `tsconfig.app.json` to include baseUrl and paths for TypeScript

### 3. Dashboard Updates
- **AdminDashboard**: Connected to users, centers, materials, payments tables
- **TeacherDashboard**: Connected to materials, students, exams, videos tables (filtered by teacher_id)
- **StudentDashboard**: Connected to subscriptions, exam_results, payments tables (filtered by student_id)
- **ParentDashboard**: Connected to students, payments tables (filtered by parent_id)
- **CompanyDashboard**: Already connected to companies and centers tables

### 4. HTTPS Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to enable HTTPS server for camera access

### 5. Loading States
- Added loading states to all dashboards with Arabic loading text

## 🔄 Pending Tasks

### 1. Restart Development Server
- The dev server needs to be restarted to apply HTTPS configuration
- Run `npm run dev` again after stopping the current process

### 2. Test Camera Functionality
- Navigate to ArEcoCrafter page and test camera access
- Ensure HTTPS is working for getUserMedia API

### 3. Database Population
- Ensure Supabase tables have sample data for testing
- Verify RLS policies are set up correctly

### 4. Error Handling
- Test error scenarios when data is not available
- Ensure proper fallbacks for empty states

## 📝 Notes
- All dashboards now fetch real data from Supabase instead of demo data
- Path aliases are configured for cleaner imports
- HTTPS is enabled for camera functionality
- Loading states prevent UI flicker during data fetching
